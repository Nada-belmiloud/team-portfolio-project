## 🧠 Team Retrospective Analysis

During this project, our team faced several technical and collaborative challenges, primarily related to managing Git branches and merge conflicts while working simultaneously on different features. 

One significant issue occurred when multiple members modified the same HTML file, leading to merge conflicts during integration. We resolved these conflicts by carefully comparing versions using git diff, discussing changes together, and using git rebase --continue after aligning the final structure. This experience improved our understanding of Git workflows and the importance of clear branch naming conventions.

The pull request and peer review process proved highly beneficial. It allowed us to maintain code quality, prevent overwriting others’ work, and ensure every change was reviewed before merging. This not only improved the reliability of the codebase but also strengthened team communication and accountability.

Overall, the project helped us learn professional development practices similar to those used in real-world software engineering — from collaborative coding and version control to deployment and documentation.
